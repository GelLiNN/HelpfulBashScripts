More VPN details:
  Look for the Cisco AnyConnect client on your Laptop or Mac. Click connect to get to the actual login screen. Password is actually your passcode: PIN + Tokencode.
    Once you have set your PIN, you will always use your Amazon username and passcode to authenticate. If for some reason after attempting your connection you are not successful, wait for the OTP tokencode to expire (the screen will go blank).
    Do not write your username or PIN on your Gemalto token; the security of the system relies in part on the fact that someone who steals your token cannot use it to log in unless they also know your PIN.
    If for some reason, after attempting your connection you are not successful, wait for the OTP token code to expire before attempting another connection.

Connection troubleshooting
  - I've set everything up, registered my token, and am entering my password with the OTP correctly, but it keeps prompting me to enter my login credentials when I try to log in. What is going on?
    This issue comes from Cisco's AnyConnect client automatic certificate authentication. Follow these steps to resolve the issue easily.
  - Open Cisco AnyConnect client and press connect. This should prompt you to enter your log in credentials. This step is necessary to load all settings, and if you've already pressed connect, you can skip it.
  - Close this pop-up.
  - Click the gear on the bottom left of the AnyConnect Client
  - Under Preferences, toggle "Enable automatic certificate selection" so that it is not checked.
  - Close preferences, and click connect. This should prompt a new window that asks you to select a certificate
  - There can be more than one certificate with the same name as your username, so select the one that has the issuer listed as "Amazon Corporate Systems." This should resolve the issue.
The Next Tokencode Prompt
  On occasion, even after you type your passcode or tokencode correctly, the system prompts you to enter the next tokencode in order to confirm your possession of the token.
  To authenticate in Next Tokencode: Wait until the tokencode changes, and then type the new one. Enter only the tokencode. Do not enter your PIN.
  If you are not granted access after correctly entering the next tokencode, visit your local support team or open a trouble ticket.

8:30 Samsite sprint meeting:
    T-Rex: Desktop App, search and replace application for tokens
        SDRs downloaded in a secure room here at Amazon.
        Investigators use it to get tokens, gives them to infosec to deserialize the tokens
        Upload reports to federal level?
        workflow:
            select ZIP file on your local machine
            T-Rex will parse all the bank account tokens
            tokens are linked to the payment instrument

        Future: no plain text entry for bank account tokens

    Noir:
        Sai was trying to optimize load time
            Filing overview page loaded all the time (how does he know?)
                He found out from customer feedback not data mining
            Sometimes it would infinitely load
            Turned async with parallel requests instead of procedural
            Going to add relations tab to the page
        Does that mean INVESTIGATORS can access any seller bank account they want?
        Account information page also optimized.
        KYC widget also optimized

    Investigators are our customers?

    SIV (seller identity verification) onboarding with new features:
        flexibility of changing requirements for SIV
        Related Items optimized for less related items
        Account information added to SIV case
        Supports 'person' entity and ALSO 'business' entity

        New tab will be added "SIV widget"
        apparently these investigators can download any of the seller identity documents the want?

    Search Re-Indexing (for cases and case indexes):
        Dynamo DB issue
        used to be 40 minutes to run
        target specific case types
        finding mismatches in the DB
        20,000 cases takes 4-5 minutes
        PWA cases support?

    Test Driven Development (TDD)
        (Think of some new feature change)
        - make sure tests pass and functionality is good before making ANY CHANGES
        - write tests that test the new functionality before you have built it
        - tests fail
        - write the new feature until your tests pass!

    Useful command:
        'brazil build server'

Friday learning series in Arizona bldg:
    - Reactive Microservices Architecture

    Architecture Principles:
        Domain-Driven-Design: standard for REST APIs.
            Api should be centered around domain objects (i.e. bank account)
            Write operations (commands):
                - open
                - close
                - debit
                - credit
            Read Operations (queries): access information with given params (IDs etc)
        Event Sourcing:
            2-col table (event #, event description)
            Save snapshots of event log for perf optimization
            Optimistic Locking:
                2 events try to happen at the same time, one fails one succeeds
        CQRS: can have different shemas for writes and reads
            writes and reads are in 2 separate storage containers
            You can even change the DB further for different queries
            Does this technique work with noSQL (in addition to RDBMS)?
                Yes and it is even more helpful for perf
        External Service Notifications:
            Event Store from above writes directly to an event stream, which actively
            sends everything to async event processors (also internal to the reactive microservice)

        Transactions and Transfers (ACID compliance)
            This is really slow and requires annoying processes (the transfer workflow)
            You can wrap this whole workflow in an async process that always exposes the state of the transfer:
                Stuck
                Success
                Escrow
                Etc

        Idempotency works well because it separates out the operations
            to run well in an event-driven architecture

        Reactive Microservices on AWS:
            - DynamoDB works really well as an event store:
                hash key (using Dynamo best practices) as the event ID
                DynamoDB writes to a DDB Stream
                AWS lambda good at consuming events from the stream
                AWS lambda publishes to Simple Notification Service (SNS)
                used kinesis (fan-out) stream to give 5 separate consumers access to the stream
            - Use CloudFormation Templates
                comes highly recommended
            - Make backups of your event store!
            - Backfill can Help
                For each item in the table, DynamoDB determines which set of attributes to write to the index based on its projection (KEYS_ONLY, INCLUDE, or ALL). It then writes these attributes to the index. During the backfill phase, DynamoDB keeps track of items that are being added, deleted, or updated in the table. The attributes from these items are also added, deleted, or updated in the index as appropriate.
                During the backfilling phase, the IndexStatus attribute is CREATING and the Backfilling attribute is true. Use the DescribeTable operation to retrieve the status of a table and all of its secondary indexes.
                While the index is backfilling, you cannot delete its parent table. However, you can still modify the provisioned throughput of the table and any of its global secondary indexes.
            - Elastic Search can also be good at reading the event store
                Using an ES cluster can be really helpful in debugging a fleet of AWS microservices.

- getting sudo privileges on my cloud dev env:
    - created issue for not being able to auth with midway
- DNS alias change through https://dns-manage-web.corp.proxy.amazon.com/
    ssh knnealy.aka.corp.amazon.com
- Set up cloud dev workplace:
    sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /workplace/knnealy
    sudo chown -R knnealy:amazon /workplace/knnealy

You can then use brazil cli to create workspaces and packages in that folder.
Below is an general example of how you one can accomplish this,
but you should replace the arguments with the package and VersionSet you
will be developing on. If you did not follow BT101 Making a code Change yet,
this is the folder you will should be running the commands in.
    cd /workplace/knnealy
    brazil ws create --name MyWorkspace --vs MyVersionSet/name
    cd MyWorkspace
    brazil ws --use -p MyPackage
- Follow this wiki to make a code change to an Amazon package
    https://w.amazon.com/index.php/BT101_Making_a_Code_Change

Stopping the server:
    ps -ef | grep brazil-build
    Find PID of the brazil-build start command and sudo kill that!!

- Install Brazil CLI 2.0 (my Mac)
    curl --negotiate -fLSsu: https://drive.corp.amazon.com/view/BrazilCLI-2.0/install-mac.sh -o /tmp/install-mac.sh && bash /tmp/install-mac.sh
- Install the Amazon tap (one time setup)
    brew tap amazon/amazon "ssh://git.amazon.com/pkg/HomebrewAmazon"
- Install NinjaDevSync
    brew install ninja-dev-sync
- Update Brew + installed packages
    brew update
    brew upgrade

After creating a workspace on your local machine with the brazil command (using BrazilCLI_2.0), you can add it to ninja-dev-sync with the -setup flag, like so:
    $ ninja-dev-sync -setup
The workspace does not have to exist on your remote machine; ninja-dev-sync will help you create it. Note that if it does exist, any changes that you haven't pushed will be obliterated.
Once you've added a workspace, just run the program to start it up:
    $ ninja-dev-sync
ninja-dev-sync will automatically detect changes you make and synchronize them. When you add new packages to your workspace, ninja-dev-sync will run brazil commands on your remote machine automatically. If there was a problem, you'll see it in bright red/orange text. Usually this just means you need to run kinit on your remote machine.
REMOVING:
    $ ninja-dev-sync -remove /w/live
    [...]
    Removing link from /w/live/src to peddicor.aka.amazon.com:/w/live/src

        I have to give myself perms to all the same queues


Samsite notes:
    Disposition can be set to “Filed”, “Not Filed”, “Duplicate", "False Positive", "Below the Threshold", “Not set”, etc. Each case only has one disposition but the investigators might want to filter cases that is either “Filed” or “Duplicate”. Therefore, a multiple-selection drop-down would be a good choice for the use case.
    Acronyms I still don't know:
        UAT - User Acceeptance Testing
        SLA - Service Level Agreement
        SOP - Standard Operating Procedure
        KYC - Know Your Customer -- is a govt mandate, info including whether they are tax paying legal residents and whether they could potentially be terrorists

My dev box endpoint:
    https://knnealy.aka.corp.amazon.com:1081/cases/all

    brazil-build start gets it on 3000 (I think?)

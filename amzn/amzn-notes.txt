More VPN details:
  Look for the Cisco AnyConnect client on your Laptop or Mac. Click connect to get to the actual login screen. Password is actually your passcode: PIN + Tokencode.
    Once you have set your PIN, you will always use your Amazon username and passcode to authenticate. If for some reason after attempting your connection you are not successful, wait for the OTP tokencode to expire (the screen will go blank).
    Do not write your username or PIN on your Gemalto token; the security of the system relies in part on the fact that someone who steals your token cannot use it to log in unless they also know your PIN.
    If for some reason, after attempting your connection you are not successful, wait for the OTP token code to expire before attempting another connection.

Connection troubleshooting
  - I've set everything up, registered my token, and am entering my password with the OTP correctly, but it keeps prompting me to enter my login credentials when I try to log in. What is going on?
    This issue comes from Cisco's AnyConnect client automatic certificate authentication. Follow these steps to resolve the issue easily.
  - Open Cisco AnyConnect client and press connect. This should prompt you to enter your log in credentials. This step is necessary to load all settings, and if you've already pressed connect, you can skip it.
  - Close this pop-up.
  - Click the gear on the bottom left of the AnyConnect Client
  - Under Preferences, toggle "Enable automatic certificate selection" so that it is not checked.
  - Close preferences, and click connect. This should prompt a new window that asks you to select a certificate
  - There can be more than one certificate with the same name as your username, so select the one that has the issuer listed as "Amazon Corporate Systems." This should resolve the issue.
The Next Tokencode Prompt
  On occasion, even after you type your passcode or tokencode correctly, the system prompts you to enter the next tokencode in order to confirm your possession of the token.
  To authenticate in Next Tokencode: Wait until the tokencode changes, and then type the new one. Enter only the tokencode. Do not enter your PIN.
  If you are not granted access after correctly entering the next tokencode, visit your local support team or open a trouble ticket.

8:30 Samsite sprint meeting:
    T-Rex: Desktop App, search and replace application for tokens
        SDRs downloaded in a secure room here at Amazon.
        Investigators use it to get tokens, gives them to infosec to deserialize the tokens
        Upload reports to federal level?
        workflow:
            select ZIP file on your local machine
            T-Rex will parse all the bank account tokens
            tokens are linked to the payment instrument

        Future: no plain text entry for bank account tokens

    Noir:
        Sai was trying to optimize load time
            Filing overview page loaded all the time (how does he know?)
                He found out from customer feedback not data mining
            Sometimes it would infinitely load
            Turned async with parallel requests instead of procedural
            Going to add relations tab to the page
        Does that mean INVESTIGATORS can access any seller bank account they want?
        Account information page also optimized.
        KYC widget also optimized

    Investigators are our customers?

    SIV (seller identity verification) onboarding with new features:
        flexibility of changing requirements for SIV
        Related Items optimized for less related items
        Account information added to SIV case
        Supports 'person' entity and ALSO 'business' entity

        New tab will be added "SIV widget"
        apparently these investigators can download any of the seller identity documents the want?

    Search Re-Indexing (for cases and case indexes):
        Dynamo DB issue
        used to be 40 minutes to run
        target specific case types
        finding mismatches in the DB
        20,000 cases takes 4-5 minutes
        PWA cases support?
